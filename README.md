# Accessibility
Improve site accessibility and SEO

## Features
I have made changes to an existing project to improve accessibility features.
They are;
- Using semantic HTML tags
- Setting the default language of the page
- Using a <figure> tag to enclose the hero banner
- Adding alt text to all images on the page
- Adding anchor tags to each main section of the page

These steps improve the readability of the page for accessibility software, such as screen readers, and general accesibility for the end user.
